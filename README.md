# AI Agent for Automated Literature Review & Summarization

Engineered an AI Agent to automate the retrieval, processing, and summarization of domain-specific research papers. This agent extracts key insights and identifies emerging trends from large volumes of textual data.

## Key Features

- Built with Python and LangChain.
- Integrates Large Language Model (LLM) APIs for advanced natural language understanding and generation.
- Utilizes Vector Databases (e.g., FAISS/Chroma) for efficient semantic search.
- Implements Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve summary relevance and accuracy.

## Tech Stack

- Python
- LangChain
- OpenAI API (or similar LLMs)
- PyTorch (embeddings)
- Vector Databases (FAISS/Chroma)
- Pandas
- NLTK/spaCy
